ENABLE_EMAIL_NOTIFICATIONS=true
```

### 2. Gmail Setup (Recommended)

2. **Generate App Password**:
   - Go to Google Account settings
   - Security â†’ 2-Step Verification â†’ App passwords
   - Generate a new app password for "Mail"

### 3. Other Email Providers

```

## Testing Email Setup

### 1. Test Email Connection

Make a GET request to test the email connection:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/email/test-connection \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### 2. Send Test Email

Send a test email to verify the setup:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/email/test \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "to": "test@example.com",
    "template": "fileForwarded",
    "data": {
      "fileCode": "THDC-F-2024-0001",
      "fileTitle": "Test File",
      "priority": "Urgent",
      "department": "IT",
      "sentBy": "John Doe",
      "recipientName": "Jane Smith",
      "sentThrough": "Email",
      "sentAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      "remarks": "Please review this test file"
    }
  }'
```

## Email Templates

### 1. File Forwarded Template
- **Trigger**: When a file is forwarded to another user/department
- **Recipients**: Department admin or intended recipient
- **Content**: File details, priority, deadline, sender info, remarks

### 2. File Released Template
- **Trigger**: When an admin releases a file to an employee
- **Recipients**: Employee who receives the file
- **Content**: File details, release information, action required

### 3. File Received Template
- **Trigger**: When an employee marks a file as received
- **Recipients**: Admin who distributed the file
- **Content**: Confirmation of file receipt, timestamp

### 4. File Completed Template
- **Trigger**: When a file is marked as completed
- **Recipients**: Admin and original sender
- **Content**: Completion details, remarks, final status

## Email Workflow

### Complete Email Flow:

1. **User forwards file** â†’ Email sent to department admin
2. **Admin distributes file** â†’ Email sent to employee
3. **Employee receives file** â†’ Email sent to admin (confirmation)
4. **Employee completes file** â†’ Email sent to admin and original sender

### Example Workflow:

```
John (IT) forwards file to HR
    â†“
Email sent to HR Admin
    â†“
HR Admin distributes to Jane (HR Employee)
    â†“
Email sent to Jane
    â†“
Jane receives the file
    â†“
Email sent to HR Admin (confirmation)
    â†“
Jane completes the file
    â†“
Email sent to HR Admin and John (original sender)
```

## Configuration Options

### Enable/Disable Notifications

```env
# Enable all email notifications
ENABLE_EMAIL_NOTIFICATIONS=true

# Disable email notifications
ENABLE_EMAIL_NOTIFICATIONS=false
```

### Custom Email Templates

You can customize email templates by modifying `backend/utils/emailService.js`:

```javascript
const emailTemplates = {
  fileForwarded: (data) => ({
    subject: `ðŸ“¤ File Forwarded: ${data.fileCode} - ${data.fileTitle}`,
    html: `Your custom HTML template here...`
  }),
  // ... other templates
};
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Authentication Failed**
   - Check SMTP credentials
   - Ensure 2FA is enabled for Gmail
   - Verify app password is correct

2. **Connection Timeout**
   - Check SMTP host and port
   - Verify firewall settings
   - Test with different email provider

3. **Emails Not Sending**
   - Check `ENABLE_EMAIL_NOTIFICATIONS` setting
   - Verify user email addresses in database
   - Check server logs for errors

### Debug Commands:

```bash
# Test email connection
curl http://localhost:5000/api/email/test-connection

# Check server logs
tail -f backend/logs/app.log

# Verify environment variables
echo $SMTP_HOST
echo $SMTP_USER
echo $ENABLE_EMAIL_NOTIFICATIONS
```

## Security Considerations

1. **App Passwords**: Use app passwords instead of regular passwords
2. **Environment Variables**: Never commit email credentials to version control
3. **Rate Limiting**: Email sending is subject to SMTP provider limits
4. **Error Handling**: Email failures don't break the main application flow

## Best Practices

1. **Test Thoroughly**: Always test email setup before production
2. **Monitor Logs**: Check email sending logs regularly
3. **Backup Configuration**: Keep email settings in secure environment files
4. **User Communication**: Inform users about email notifications
5. **Template Updates**: Review and update email templates as needed

## API Endpoints

### Email Testing Endpoints:

- `GET /api/email/test-connection` - Test email server connection
- `POST /api/email/test` - Send test email

### Automatic Email Triggers:
