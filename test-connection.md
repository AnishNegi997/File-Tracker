# Quick Connection Test Guide

## Issues Fixed

âœ… **JSX Attribute Warning**: Removed `jsx` attribute from `<style>` tag in Sidebar component
âœ… **Async Data Loading**: Updated all components to handle async `getAllFiles()` calls properly
âœ… **Loading States**: Added loading spinners to all components that fetch data

## Test the Connection

### 1. Start Both Servers

**Option A: Use the batch script**
```bash
# Double-click start-servers.bat
```

**Option B: Manual start**
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 2. Verify Backend is Running

Open browser to: `http://localhost:5000/api/health`

Should return: `{"message":"Server is running"}`

### 3. Test Frontend Login

1. Go to: `http://localhost:5173`
2. Login with test credentials:
   - Email: `alice@company.com`
   - Password: `password123`
3. Should redirect to dashboard

### 4. Test Data Loading

Navigate to these pages to verify data loads properly:
- **Dashboard**: Should show stats
- **Track Files**: Should show file list with search
- **Received Files**: Should show received files for your role
- **Incoming Files**: Should show incoming files
- **Department Files**: Should show department-specific files

### 5. Check Browser Console

Look for:
- âœ… No CORS errors
- âœ… No "filter is not a function" errors
- âœ… No JSX attribute warnings
- âœ… API calls returning data

## Expected Behavior

- **Loading States**: Each page should show a spinner while loading data
- **Data Display**: After loading, data should appear in tables/lists
- **Error Handling**: If backend is down, pages should show empty states gracefully
- **Authentication**: Protected routes should work with JWT tokens

## Troubleshooting

### If you see "filter is not a function" errors:
- Make sure backend is running on port 5000
- Check that API endpoints are responding
- Clear browser cache and reload

### If you see CORS errors:
- Verify backend CORS_ORIGIN is set to `http://localhost:5173`
- Check that both servers are running

### If data doesn't load:
- Check browser Network tab for failed API calls
- Verify authentication token is being sent
- Check backend console for errors

## Success Indicators

âœ… No console errors
âœ… Data loads in all pages
âœ… Loading spinners work
âœ… Authentication works
âœ… Navigation between pages works

The frontend and backend are now properly connected! ðŸŽ‰
