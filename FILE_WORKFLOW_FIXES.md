# File Workflow Fixes - Received & Incoming Files

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Received Files Not Showing
**Problem**: Files were not appearing in the "Received Files" page for users.

**Root Cause**: 
- Files were created with status "Created" but needed status "Released" or "Received" to appear in Received Files
- Filtering logic was not properly handling file assignments
- Missing proper API endpoints for user-specific file retrieval

**Solution**:
- Added new API endpoint `/api/files/user/:userId` for user-specific file retrieval
- Improved filtering logic in `ReceivedFiles.jsx` to use the new endpoint
- Added "Release File" functionality for admins to change file status from "Created" to "Released"

### 2. Incoming Files Not Showing
**Problem**: Files were not appearing in the "Incoming Files" page for users.

**Root Cause**:
- Incoming files logic was not properly integrated with the forwarding system
- Regular users needed to see both forwarded files and directly assigned files
- Missing proper status handling for different file types

**Solution**:
- Enhanced `IncomingFiles.jsx` to show both forwarded files and directly assigned files
- Added "Receive File" button for users to mark distributed files as received
- Improved status handling and user experience

## New Features Added

### 1. Release File Functionality
**Location**: All Files page (for admins)
**Purpose**: Allow admins to directly release files to employees

**How to use**:
1. Go to "All Files" page
2. Find a file with status "Created"
3. Click the "ðŸ“¤ Release" button
4. Select an employee from the dropdown
5. Click "Release File"

**Result**: File status changes to "Released" and appears in the employee's "Received Files"

### 2. Enhanced File Filtering
**Location**: All Files page
**Features**:
- Search by file code, title, or requisitioner
- Filter by department
- Filter by status
- Clear filters option

### 3. Improved User Experience
